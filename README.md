For iOS and Android developers: Do you even have another choice?

Things to look out:
Using a frontend framework like angularjs would be a bonus
Using a backend framework like flask would be a bonus
We look out for maintainability of your code. 

You should fork this repository and put your work there. 
This exercise should take no longer than 2 days. However, you are not timed

live going on, even better!)
